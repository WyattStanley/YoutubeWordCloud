Geog358: Word Clouds Based on Youtube Web Crawlers

Please create a narrative based on your research. In your narrative, please describe

the topic as well as the parameters you have used for search (5 PTS)

In this project I aimed to compare the perception of public transportation in North America vs. Europe. America is known for having poor public transportation infastructure while Europe is known for exelent public transportation. For the most accurate searches I wanted to find information on each contries city with the best public transportation as well as the country as a whole. For the North American web crawler search I used two prompts, the first used the words "North", "America", "Public", Transportation", and the second was was based on Seattle which was ranked as the city with the best public transportation in the USA. For that search I used the words "Seattle", "Washington", "Public", "Transportation". For the European web crawler search I used the city Zurich in Swizerland becasue it was ranked to have the best public transportation in Europe. For Zurich I used the words "Zurich", "Swizerland", "Public", "Transportation". For Europe as a whole I used the words "Europe", "Public", "Transportation". Once I collected the data I deleted all the words I used for the search from the word cloud and I also deleated all but a few words that only showed up once. I did this because I didn't want the clouds to make up mostly the words I searched for or words that werent trends in data. 

why do you want to make this comparison (5 PTS)

I wanted to make this comparison to see if there is a clear difference of perception based on Youtube. From my own experiece there are a lot of people in the United States who want public transportation infastructer to be improved while there are many people who dont care for public transportation and prefere driving. In Europe, trains and other forms of public transportation are more widespread and are more publicly accepted. I was curious to see if this was obvious through Youtube word trends.

compare the word clouds and discuss the difference or similarity among the word clouds (5 PTS)

The word clouds are very similar when only obseving the largest words. The biggest word for North America is "Transit" and the biggest word for Europe is "Transport". Both word clouds also have words like "Bus", "Train", and "Rail". In most cases they are very similar. These clouds only get interesting once you start looking at the smaller words.

what might be the possible reasons for the patterns you observed (5 PTS)

how your research could be improved in the future (5 PTS)

anything you find from the map or data that is different from your expectation before the exercise, or anything that stands out to you (5 PTS)

Export the two or more word clouds to the repository and then insert them to the readme.md. (5 PTS)

The readme.md also needs to include a url to download the result spreadsheets (csv file) of the collected data (5 PTS).
